% Function to perform poisson image editing using a sparse solver.
% Inputs:
%       src:target image, where area destined for blending has been
%            replaced by region of interest from source (i.e. cut &
%            paste)
%       Fh: horizontal gradient field of target image, where gradient field for area destined for blending has been
%            replaced by horizontal gradient field of region of interest
%            from source
%       Fv: vertical gradient field of target image, where gradient field for area destined for blending has been
%            replaced by vertical gradient field of region of interest
%            from source
%       msk: binary image, same size as src, where area to per
